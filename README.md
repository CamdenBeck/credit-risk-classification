# Credit Risk Classification

## Overview
This project involves building the logistic regression machine learning model to classify credit risk. The goal is to predict whether a loan applicant poses a high or low credit risk based on their income, debt, and other relevant factors.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains various features related to the financial status of loan applicants, such as:
- Loan amount
- Interest rate
- Income
- Debt-to-income ratio
- Credit history
- Loan status

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CamdenBeck/credit-risk-classification.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd credit-risk-classification
```
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to train and evaluate the model:
```bash
jupyter notebook credit_risk_classification.ipynb
```

## Model
The model used for this project is a Logistic Regression algorithm.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 99% on the test set. The following metrics were used to evaluate the model:
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to classify credit risk.
